Test Automation code is a living entity. It's undergoes changes all the time. You add new features to the automation framework. You fix some issues sometimes. Sometimes there is a need to increase test execution speed so you make some configuration changes. If nothing else changes, sometimes applications under test start behaving peculiarly (E.g. you need to change max. timeout values as application is particularly slow in a specific test environment). The automation tools in use may show different colors after a version upgrade. So many things change.

All this is still fine, when you write test automation code either for your own use or for the use of small testing teams. You can quickly fix the issues and can bring automation on track again. The things aren't so easy and straightforward, when the End Userbase is large, varied and have varied expectations from your automation framework. It becomes imperative that you test your automation framework features thoroughly and ensure it works as expected when you release a new version.

## Testing core automation functionality

What if I tell you, you should thoroughly test core automation framework features before you release it to your user base?
